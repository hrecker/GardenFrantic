# Game Overview
![Gameplay](screenshots/gameplay1.png?raw=true)

In Garden Frantic, you must keep your plant healthy by monitoring its water and light levels, while also defending against dangerous hazards. While the plant is healthy it will grow fruit, which you can harvest for bonus points. You have access to an array of tools that can be used to manage your plants health and to defeat the various hazards you are faced with.

Hazards will approach more frequently the longer your plant survives. Stay alive as long as possible to reach a high score.

The game features three difficulty levels.
